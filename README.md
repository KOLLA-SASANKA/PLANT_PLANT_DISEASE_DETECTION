## Introduction

Early detection of plant leaf diseases is crucial for timely intervention and treatment, which can significantly improve crop yield and quality. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically classify plant leaf diseases from images, reducing the need for manual inspection.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Evaluation**: Sklearn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-leaf-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-leaf-disease-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Preprocess the images and labels using the provided scripts.
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of images of plant leaves, categorized into different disease classes. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own by collecting and labeling images.
